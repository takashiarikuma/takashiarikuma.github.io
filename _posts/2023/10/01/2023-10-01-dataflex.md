# What is DataFlex?

DataFlex is an advanced software development tool for building Web, Mobile, and Windows database applications.
Developed by Data Access Worldwide, it combines rapid development with well-organized, reusable, and maintainable code.
There are More than 1 million users on DataFlex.

Main features include:
- Supports many relational database environments: Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and any ODBC database. DataFlex’s multi-level architecture abstracts an application’s database from its business rules and user interfaces. 
- Switch between database backends without code changes. Optional "Connectivity Kits" include a set of database drivers that allow applications to be deployed on key industry databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, MySQL, Amazon Aurora, MariaDB and generic ODBC data sources. As requirements change, a database or data source can be changed or added by simply installing the appropriate database driver(s).
- Fullstack platform to develop applications from UI to database. With one language, one Studio, one framework and one place to manage business rules for all environments, DataFlex is easier to learn and less complex to use. The comprehensive, carefully designed technical aspects of the DataFlex platform lead to more productive developers, reduced project and maintenance time and lower costs.
- Manage business rules with Data Dictionaries. In DataFlex, business rules that centrally define table relationships and manage database operations are contained in "Data Dictionaries," a core component of the application framework. They validate all database operations to ensure data quality and integrity. They also enforce UI consistency by defining data’s default visual representation across all devices. Changes made to Data Dictionaries propagate throughout web, mobile and Windows apps. With DataFlex Data Dictionaries, building and maintaining applications is faster and easier and data quality is maintained.
- A framework for business applications. The DataFlex framework is a complete, integrated, skeletal structure of a business application. Its resources include database connectivity, a business rules repository, data-aware user interface controls and more for web, mobile and Windows environments. With just one framework, developers are more efficient and write less code so they build and maintain more applications faster. The language is an object-oriented programming language that is high-level, readable and easy to learn. The power of the language is that it is uniquely designed to harness the productivity of the DataFlex business application framework to develop reliable, high-performance business applications with less code.
